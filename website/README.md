# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Refresh your AWS MFA code:
```
aws-mfa --profile parent
```

Deploying to staging:
```console
# deploy with dry-run enabled
AWS_PROFILE=staging bin/deploy

# perform the deployment for real
AWS_PROFILE=staging DRY_RUN=false bin/deploy
```

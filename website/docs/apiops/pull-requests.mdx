title: API Changelogs in Pull Requests

Optic makes API Changes a first-class concern during code review. Every time a Pull Request is opened, Optic comments on the PR with a detailed API Changelog:

import Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper';

<Paper elevation={2}>

</Paper>


## How it Works
When a pull request is opened, the Optic GitBot compares the current specification to the specification in the base branch. The differences are summarized and posted in a comment. It's amazing how many second and third order benefits teams report just from having observability into how their APIs work, and having "API Changes" as an explicit, first-class concern in every Pull Request. Just shining a light on API changes during code review has a strong influence on how teams think about the work theyâ€™re doing.

## Install the Bot
